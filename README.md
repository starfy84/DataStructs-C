# DataStructs-C
All your favourite data structures remastered in C.

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

All data structures are coded entirely using the C programming language, developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie. This repository includes many of the necessary data structures for everyday coding. With trees, queues, deques, maps, and even linked lists, one can even find themselves coding graph theory in C.
